"Prediction of Infliximab Loss of Response or Adverse Event in a National Cohort of Patients with IBD: Comparison of Traditional and Machine Learning Models." (2024).

In this work, we aimed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of non-medical biosimilar switch of Infliximab (IFX), a highly effective and cost effective treatment for Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). To that end, we developed various statistical and machine learning models to predict adverse clinical events among patients on maintenance IFX.

## Installing Dependencies

This project includes both and R and Python code. In general, R was used to perform the survival analysis while Python was used to perform the classification analysis. To facilitate reproducibility, we have created reproducible environments using [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) and [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) for R and Python, respectively. These reproducible environments, which include all necessary package dependencies, can be installed as follows:

In R/Rstudio, navigate to the root repository directory and run
```r
renv::restore()
```
to reproduce the R environment for this project.

In your terminal, navigate to the root repository directory and run
```bash
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```
to reproduce the Python environment for this project.
